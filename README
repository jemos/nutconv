nutconv v0.1

Motivation: required a fast tool to convert nutascii format to
other formats, namely, CSV. This way spectre output simulation
data can be reused in other programs (eg.: Matlab, gnuplot, etc.).

It is known that using Ocean ocnPrint function one can actually
print the signals in a formated string however that requires the
usage of Ocean to do all the simulation (using selectResults with
spectre made psf results not always works).
